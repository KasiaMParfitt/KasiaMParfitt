#Load in data (df is the standard curve and unknowns are the concentrations you want to find based on OD)
df<-read.csv(file.choose())
unknowns<-read.csv(file.choose())

#Check standard curve as a test before use
plot(data=df, y~x)

#Create plot of standard curve (unfiltered)
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()

#Filter the standard curve based on the first few points (more accurate)
df %>%
  filter(x<25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x)

#Create a filtered standard curve
df_filtered<-filter(df, x<25)
#Create a line using the linear model of the filtered standard curve
line<-lm(df_filtered$y~df_filtered$x)

#Find the intercept and slope of the standard curve
intercept<-line$coefficients[1]
slope<-line$coefficients[2]

#List the unknown concentrations using y=mc^2 equations
unknown_concs<-round((unknowns[3]-intercept)/slope,1)
